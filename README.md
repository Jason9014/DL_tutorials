# Deep Learning Tutorials
This repository contains three Deep Learning tutorials which I wrote for the Machine Learning course at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

They have been designed for a three hours class, in which students can get to know automatic differentiation and SGD and design some simple Neural Networks.

* **[Tutorial 1](01_Linear_Regression.ipynb)**: Training a Linear Regression model with SGD and Keras backend.
* **[Tutorial 2](02_MLP.ipynb)**: Multilayer Perceptron in Keras on the MNIST dataset
* **[Tutorial 3](03_CNN.ipynb)**: A Convolutional Neural Network trained on the CIFAR10 dataset
